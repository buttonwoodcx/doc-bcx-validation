## Different from the others, our view is naive

> Validation is a function that takes `model` (not just key-val pairs) and `rule` as input, produces a structured `errors` (we will see shortly why we use plural) object as output. No more and no less.

### We don't provider features that you commonly see in the alternatives.

* No view template integrations.
* No front-end framework integrations.
* No mutation observation or monitoring.

Why? Because it's simpler and more flexible without them.
