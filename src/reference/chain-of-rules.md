## Chain of rules

You can use multiple rules to validate a value. `bcx-validation` will merge all error messages into one single array.

```javascript
validation.validate("lorem", [
 {validate: /[a-z]/, message: "must contain lower case letter"},
 {validate: /[A-Z]/, message: "must contain upper case letter"},
 {validate: /\d/, message: "must contain digit"},
]);
// => ['must contain upper case letter', 'must contain digit']
```

When `bcx-validation` validates the value, you have chance to break the chain (stop it early) using reserved keys `stopValidationChainIfFail` and `stopValidationChainIfPass`. Here the 3rd rule is skipped because of failure on the 2nd rule.

```javascript
validation.validate("lorem", [
 {validate: /[a-z]/, message: "must contain lower case letter", stopValidationChainIfFail: true},
 {validate: /[A-Z]/, message: "must contain upper case letter", stopValidationChainIfFail: true},
 {validate: /\d/, message: "must contain digit"},
]);
// => ['must contain upper case letter']
```

`bcx-validation` also provides three validators to support easy early break of chain. `passImmediatelyIf`, `skipImmediatelyIf`, `failImmediatelyIf`.

```javascript
var rule = [
  {validate: "passImmediatelyIf", value: "$value == 'NA'"},
  {validate: "failImmediatelyIf", value: "_.isEmpty($value)", message: "must not be empty"},
  {validate: /[a-z]/, message: "must contain lower case letter", stopValidationChainIfFail: true},
  {validate: /[A-Z]/, message: "must contain upper case letter", stopValidationChainIfFail: true},
  {validate: /\d/, message: "must contain digit"},
];

validation.validate("NA", rule);
// => undefined

validation.validate("", rule);
// => ['must not be empty']
```

Here the first validation checks if value is `"NA"`, stop the validation chain immediately and return as passed. The second validation checks if value is empty, stop the validation chain immediately and fail with message "must not be empty".

> We kept rest of the rule unchanged, but you can rewrite the third rule as `{validate: "failImmediatelyIf", value => !/[a-z]/.test(v), message: "must contain lower case letter"}`.

> You can use `skipImmediatelyIf` in first validation. It behaves same as `passImmediatelyIf` in this use case. The difference between `skip` and `pass` is that `bcx-validation` actually has 3 states for result: `pass`, `fail` and `skip` (considered neither pass nor fail). The final result generated by `validation.validate(...)` only contains error literals, the tri-state was not exposed to end user. State `skip` was designed to properly implement conditional validation (the `if` transformer).

Since chain of rules is considered a rule, you can use sub-chain inside a chain. Beware early break of sub-chain doesn't affect the outer chain. Here the last rule was still checked after early break in previous sub-chain.

```javascript
var rule = [
  {validate: "passImmediatelyIf", value: "$value == 'NA'"},
  {validate: "failImmediatelyIf", value: "_.isEmpty($value)", message: "must not be empty"},
  [
    {validate: /[a-z]/, message: "must contain lower case letter", stopValidationChainIfFail: true},
    {validate: /[A-Z]/, message: "must contain upper case letter", stopValidationChainIfFail: true},
    {validate: /\d/, message: "must contain digit"}
  ],
  {validate: /_/, message: "must contain underscore"}
];

validation.validate("a", rule);
// => [ 'must contain upper case letter', 'must contain underscore' ]
```

With the introduction of chain control, it looks getting complicated. But fortunately, you will rarely use any of `passImmediatelyIf`, `skipImmediatelyIf`, `failImmediatelyIf`, `stopValidationChainIfFail` or `stopValidationChainIfPass`. They are meant to be used in defining new validator with composition.

#### Conditional validation (if transformer)
Before we get into composition, let's have a look of conditional validation.

```javascript
validation.validate("NA", {if: "$value != 'NA'", validate: /id\d+/, message: "invalid id format"});
// => undefined
validation.validate("xx", {if: "$value != 'NA'", validate: /id\d+/, message: "invalid id format"});
// => [ 'invalid id format' ]
validation.validate("id23", {if: "$value != 'NA'", validate: /id\d+/, message: "invalid id format"});
// => undefined
```

> We only support expression in `if` condition check, not function. This is to support an edge case that user really want to validate a property named "if" in the model. We will show example of this edge case in [nested rule](#/reference/nested-rule).

Conditional validation was implemented as `if` transformer. When `bcx-validation` sees that conditional rule above, it transforms it into:

```javascript
validation.validate("NA", [
  {validate: "skipImmediatelyIf", value: "!($value != 'NA')"},
  {validate: /id\d+/, message: "invalid id format"}
]);
```

You can see we will rarely use `skipImmediatelyIf` directly, `if` transformer does the job, and makes the whole rule short and neat.

`if` transformer can wrap chain of rules too. Here is a rewrite of the previous chain rule.

```javascript
var rule = {
  if: "$value != 'NA'",
  group: [
    // 'mandatory' validator is almost same as {validate: "failImmediatelyIf", value: "_.isEmpty($value)", message: "must not be empty"},
    "mandatory",
    [
      {validate: /[a-z]/, message: "must contain lower case letter", stopValidationChainIfFail: true},
      {validate: /[A-Z]/, message: "must contain upper case letter", stopValidationChainIfFail: true},
      {validate: /\d/, message: "must contain digit"}
    ],
    {validate: /_/, message: "must contain underscore"}
  ]
};
```

Let's move on to [validator composition](#/reference/validator-composition).
